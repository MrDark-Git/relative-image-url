## my test

# relative-image-url
The Stack Overflow question that I found asking if relative image links were supported said "No", but they are.

The following link is what's used below.

    ![Kiku](../images/Kiku.jpg)

![Kiku](../images/Kiku.jpg)

<img src="../images/Kiku.jpg"  width="600">

<p align="center">
<img src="../images/Kiku.jpg"  width="200">
</p>
